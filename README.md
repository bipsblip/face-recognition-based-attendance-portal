# face-recognition-based-attendance-portal

This is a Flask-based attendance system that utilizes facial recognition to track attendance. It allows users to add people to the system, generate a dataset of their facial images, train a classifier, and perform real-time face recognition for attendance tracking.

## Features

- Add new people to the system with their name and skill.
- Generate a dataset of facial images for a specific person.
- Train a classifier using the generated dataset.
- Perform real-time face recognition for attendance tracking.
- Display a live video feed with recognized faces highlighted.
- View and clear attendance records for the current date.
- Download attendance records in excel sheets

## Uses

## Deployment

To deploy the Attendance System, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install flask opencv-python mysql-connector-python pillow
```

2. Set up a MySQL database and update the `mydb` connection parameters in the code to match your database configuration.

3. Download the Haar cascade XML file for face detection and update the file path in the code (`face_classifier` variable).

4. Run the Flask application by executing the following command:
```
python app.py
```

5. Access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

Note: Make sure you have a webcam connected to your computer for real-time face recognition.
